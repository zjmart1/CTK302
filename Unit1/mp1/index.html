  <h1>Pancake Man</h1>
    <p>He was created by a scientist as an accident, and while the rest of the
      batch was destroyed, pancake man was able to escape. The scientist has alerted
      the government <br>of the escaped science expiriment. He spends his time
      running from the scientists and the government, and along the way he
      is attempting to destroy all other breakfast food, so the pancakes will reign.</p>
